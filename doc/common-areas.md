# Common Areas

1. **Common areas are designed and furnished by consensus.** You should ask roommates before adding/removing furniture or changing artwork. We should collectively encourage everyone to feel ownership and creative in their home, while maintaining respect for everyone's individual taste in living environment.

2. **Common areas should be kept clean and free of personal belongings.** Do not store personal items in common areas. There is ample storage in the attic and basement.

3. **The garage is common space that you can claim for personal use.** You can designate reasonable sized areas of the garage for a workspace, bike/equipment storage, or anything else. Your space requirements should be mindful of the space requirements of others.
